### 🌟 **Introduction** 🌟

Welcome to Day 7 of the #90DaysOfDevOps challenge. In this blog, we'll explore package manager and its essential tools like APT (Advanced Package Tool) 🛠️ and YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified) 🛠️, along with the role of systemctl and systemd. Our first task will be installing Docker 🐳 and Jenkins 🏗️ using package managers. For Docker installation, we'll set up the repository, while for Jenkins, we'll utilize APT on Ubuntu. Additionally, we'll learn to check the status of the Docker service, stop the Jenkins service, and understand the difference between systemctl and service commands. Let's dive in and unlock the power of efficient software management in the Linux environment! 🚀

### 📦 **What is a package?**

In Linux, a package is a software distribution format that contains all the necessary files and information 📃 required to install and manage a specific piece of software. Packages typically include the executable binaries 💾, libraries 📚, configuration files 📝, and documentation 📄 needed to run the software on a Linux system 🐧.

### 🧰 **What is a package manager in Linux?**

A package manager is a tool that is used to install, upgrade, manage and remove packages. It is responsible to manage dependencies and to track all installed packages.

### 🛠️ **Different kinds of package managers**

There are two popular package managers APT (Advanced Package Tool) and YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified).

**APT (Advanced Package Tool):** APT is widely used in Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu and is known for its user-friendly command-line interface. This package manager simplifies the process of interacting with the package management system, making it easier for users to perform various operations. 🛠️

With APT, you can effortlessly install, update, and remove packages using simple commands:

* To install a package: `sudo apt-get install package_name`
    
* To update packages: `sudo apt-get update` followed by `sudo apt-get upgrade`
    
* To remove a package: `sudo apt-get remove package_name`
    

One of the significant advantages of APT is its automatic resolution of package dependencies. When you install a package, APT ensures that all required dependencies are also installed, preventing any conflicts or issues.

**YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified):** YUM is commonly used in Red Hat-based distributions like CentOS and Fedora. Similar to APT, YUM provides a command-line interface for managing packages, making it convenient for users to handle software installations. 🛠️

* To install a package: `sudo yum install package_name`
    
* To update packages: `sudo yum update` followed by `sudo apt-get upgrade`
    
* To remove a package: `sudo yum remove package_name`
    

One of the key features of YUM is its ability to manage package dependencies seamlessly. When you install or update a package using YUM, it automatically resolves dependencies, ensuring that all required packages are downloaded and installed correctly.

### 🔍 **Understanding systemctl and systemd**

**systemd:** `systemd` is a system and service manager for Linux. It serves as the init system, replacing SysVinit in modern distributions due to enhanced features and improved performance.

It manages system initialization, processes, startup, shutdown, and resource utilization efficiently. One key advantage is starting services in parallel, reducing boot times. It provides socket activation for on-demand service start.

Commonly used commands: `systemctl` and `journalctl`.

**systemctl:** `Systemctl` is a command-line utility used to manage system services in Linux distributions that adopt the `systemd init` system. `Systemd` is a system and service manager that provides advanced features such as process management, logging, and service dependencies.

**Commands:**

* 🔍 `sudo systemctl start service_name`
    
* 🛠️ `sudo systemctl stop service_name`
    
* 🔄 `sudo systemctl restart service_name`
    
* 🔔 `sudo systemctl enable service_name`
    
* 🔕 `sudo systemctl disable service_name`
    

### 🐳 **Task 1: Installing Docker and Jenkins Using Package Managers**

🚀 Time to apply our package manager expertise! We'll now install Docker and Jenkins on Ubuntu using package managers. Let's dive in and get our hands dirty! 💻

**• Installing Docker on Ubuntu using APT**

1. Update the package lists: 🔄
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    ```
    
2. Install the Docker repository: 📦
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
    ```
    
3. To check the version of the docker: 🚀
    
    ```plaintext
    docker version
    ```
    

**• Installing Jenkins on Ubuntu using APT**

To install Jenkins on Ubuntu using APT, follow these steps:

1. Jenkins requires **Java** to run, so we'll update the Debian apt repositories, install OpenJDK 17, and check the installation with the commands:
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
    java -version
    ```
    
2. Next, let’s install the Jenkins Long-Term Support release by using the below commands:
    
    ```plaintext
    curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
      /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
    echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
      https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
      /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install jenkins
    ```
    
3. Start the Jenkins service:
    
    ```plaintext
     sudo systemctl start jenkins
    ```
    
4. Enable Jenkins to start on system boot:
    
    ```plaintext
     sudo systemctl enable jenkins
    ```
    

Jenkins should now be installed and running on your Ubuntu system. You can access it by opening your web browser and navigating to [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080). 🌐🎉

### 🔦 **Task 2: Checking the Status of the Docker Service**

Now that Docker is set up on your system, let's see how to check its status using the "systemctl" command.

To check the status of the Docker service, simply run this command: 🔍

```plaintext
systemctl status docker
```

The output will show you important details about Docker, such as whether it's running, enabled, and any recent log entries related to its activity. This helps you ensure that Docker is up and running smoothly on your system. 👍🚀

### 🛑 **Task 3: Stopping the Jenkins Service**

To stop the Jenkins service, you can use the following command:

```plaintext
sudo systemctl stop jenkins
```

Running this command will halt the Jenkins service, bringing it to a stop. It will no longer be running on your system until you start it again.

### 💡 **Difference between systemctl and service**

`systemctl` and `service` are both commands used to manage services in Linux, but they have some differences in their functionality and usage.

**systemctl**:

* `systemctl` is a more modern and 🛸 powerful service management utility introduced with systemd, which is the default init system in many modern Linux distributions.
    
* It provides ✨ extensive features for controlling services, including starting, stopping, restarting, enabling (starting at boot), disabling (not starting at boot), and checking the status of services.
    
* Example: To check the status of the Docker service using `systemctl`, you would use the following command:
    
    ```plaintext
    systemctl status docker
    ```
    

**service**:

* `service` is a legacy command used in init-based systems (SysVinit) to manage services.
    
* It is still available in many Linux distributions for backward compatibility but is being phased out in favor of `systemctl`.
    
* `service` provides a simpler interface for starting, stopping, and restarting services, but it has fewer features compared to `systemctl`. ⏳
    
* Example: To check the status of the Docker service using `service`, you would use the following command: 👇
    
    ```plaintext
    service docker status
    ```
