## **Task 1** ✅ **: Check your present working directory.**

To check your present working directory in Linux, you can use the "pwd" command. Open the terminal and simply type "pwd" followed by pressing the "Enter" key. The command will display the full path of the directory you are currently in. This will help you know where you are in the file system while navigating and executing commands.
